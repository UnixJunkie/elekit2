The MALOC TODO List
-------------------

This is the MALOC "TODO" list, basically a list of known problems that need
to be fixed, or desirable features that I (or someone else) would like to
add to MALOC.  The list is divided into sublists, according to which primary 
component of MALOC the task involves hacking into.  The column on the left
side of each sublist refers to which state the task is currently in:

  o <Open>        ==> It is not completed, and no one is working on it yet.
  - <In Progress> ==> Someone is working on it, but it is not done.
  x <Completed>   ==> The task has been completed and the code has been tested.

For the "in progress" tasks, the name of the person working on it (usually me)
will usually be listed somewhere in the description of the task.
